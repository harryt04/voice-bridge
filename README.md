# Self-hosting your own instance

1. Supply values for the environment variables. A sample file can be found in `.env.sample`.
1. That's it. Depnding on your hosting provider, the next steps vary wildly. I choose to host this on [Coolify](https://coolify.io/docs), which is a self-hosted version of Vercel, basically. But if you're new to next.js, I'd recommend trying out [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).

# Creating indexes for your own mongodb instance

1. Supply your `defaultConnectionString` in `lib/mongo-client.ts`
1. Run `gulp create-indexes` at the repo root to create indexes for the collections in your mongodb instance.
   - If you get an error about gulp not being found, run `npm install -g gulp` to install gulp globally, then try again.
